<li> Sugar: Just a tablespoon of white sugar is all you'll need for subtly sweet pancakes.</li>
<li> Salt: A pinch of salt will enhance the overall flavor without making your pancakes taste salty.</li>
<li> Milk and butter: Milk and butter add moisture and richness to the pancakes.</li>
<li> Egg: A whole egg lends even more moisture. Plus, it helps bind the pancake batter together.</li>
